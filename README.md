# eci
A single html page which shows the result of ECI campaign for UBI. 

Only html and javascript in frontend. php is used for backend only. With php (ecitable.php and langresourcs.php), the external json data is read from europa.eu and ubi-europe.net, partially also from static json files. Them the data is decoded, restructured and finally json-encoded again for frontend use. javascript reads the data from own server only.

Feel free to make pull request if something is to improved :)
